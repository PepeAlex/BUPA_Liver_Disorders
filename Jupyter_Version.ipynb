    "This paper is a research about the BUPA Liver Disorders dataset and its importance. I have written some Python codes to demonstrate this dataset more easily and more didactically. Finally, I will summarise my findings and present my conclusion. This project is part of the semester end requirement in the discipline of Programming & Scripting at GMIT.\n",

    "This project is avaiable at https://github.com/PepeAlex/BUPA_Project. In order to try it as a programer, some programms and libraries will need to be installed.\n",
    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The liver is an important organ that performs hundreds of tasks related to metabolism, energy storage, and detoxification of waste. It helps to digest food, convert it to energy, and store the energy until needed. It also helps to filter toxic substances out of the bloodstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liver disease is a general term that refers to any condition affecting the liver. These conditions may develop for different reasons, but they can all damage the liver and impact its function. https://www.healthline.com/health/what-does-the-liver-do .\n",
    "\n",
    "WHAT ARE SOME COMMON LIVER PROBLEMS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many conditions can affect the liver. Here is a summary of some of the main ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hepatitis\n",
    "\n",
    "Hepatitis is a viral infection of the liver. It causes inflammation and liver damage, making it difficult for the liver to function as it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fatty liver disease\n",
    "\n",
    "Fatty liver is also known as hepatic steatosis. It happens when fat builds up in the liver. Having small amounts of fat in the liver is normal, but too much can become a health problemç one of the primary causes is too much alcohol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoimmune Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoimmune conditions involve the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy cells in the body.\n",

    "BUPA\n",
    "\n",
    "The BUPA Liver Disorders dataset was created by BUPA Medical Research Ltd on May 15, 1990ç the heard of this project was Richard S. Forsyth. This project collected samples of 345 male patients and analysed seven variables created by BUPA researchers: five \"blood\" (blood tests), one \"drinks\" (number of drinks per day), and one \"field\" (train versus test results) . https://www.openml.org/d/8\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- MCV - Mean Corpuscular Volume. An MCV blood test measures the average size of red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes. https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/mcv-mean-corpuscular-volume/\n",
    "\n",
    "2- ALKPHOS – Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in several tissues throughout the body. The highest concentrations of ALP are present in the cells that comprise bone and the liver. https://labtestsonline.org/tests/alkaline-phosphatase-alp#\n",
    "\n",
    "3- SGTP - Sérum glutamic pyruvic transaminase. An enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells. SGPT is released into the blood when the liver or heart is damaged. https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6321\n",
    "\n",
    "4- SGOT - Sérum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase. An enzyme that is normally present in liver and heart cells, SGOT is released into the blood when the liver or heart is damaged. https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6320\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Gamma GT - glutamytransferase. An enzyme found in liver cells and the biliary tract, it is a very sensitive indicator of abnormality in the liver or bile duct system. http://www.irishhealth.com/askdoc.html?q=6201\n",
    "\n",
    "6- DRINKS - number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day. https://www.openml.org/d/8\n",

    "7- FIELD - selector field created by the BUPA researchers to split the data into train/test sets. https://www.openml.org/d/8\n",

    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this project, I have used some programmes and their libraries; below is a short description of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "PYTHON\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level, built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python Libraries:\n",
    "        Matplotlib: is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits. https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "        Pandas: is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Pandas is a NumFOCUS sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project, and makes it possible to donate to the project. https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "        Seaborn: is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "CMDER\n",
    "\n",
    "CMDER is a software package created out of the absence of suitable console emulators in Windows. It is based on quality software, with a Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout. https://cmder.net/\n",
    "\n",
    "VSCODE\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code – VSCode is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",

    "\n",
    "GITHUB\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features; while Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_cs=QdRUp8Vpgm9JNIVT4qpoSA\n",
